3- Swedish Grammatical Sentence Structures:

    For each sentence, provide only the grammatical structure required to construct the Swedish version of the sentence.

    Label each sentence separately (e.g., "Sentence 1 Grammatical Structure," "Sentence 2 Grammatical Structure," etc.).

    Use grammatical terminology to describe word order and necessary grammatical adjustments.
    
    DO NOT provide translations, but instead, describe the sentence structure using Swedish grammar rules.

    Format Example:

        Sentence 1 Grammatical Structure:

            Sentence Type: (e.g., Question, Declarative statement, Imperative)
            Grammatical Structures:
            Word order (e.g., SVO, VSO, etc.)
            Tense (e.g., past, present, future)
            Definite and indefinite noun usage
            Prepositional phrase placement
            Adverbial placement (Include guidance on how adverbs function within the sentence e.g., time, location, manner, frequency, etc.)
            
        Sentence 2 Grammatical Structure:

            Sentence Type: (e.g., Question, Declarative statement, Imperative)
            Grammatical Structures:
            Yes/no question structure (verb-first word order)
            Past tense verb placement
            Definite plural noun usage
            Adverbial placement (Include guidance on how adverbs function within the sentence e.g., time, location, manner, frequency, etc.)

5- Grammar Notes (Optional):

    Explain any relevant grammar rules, structures, or concepts that are important for understanding sentence construction.
