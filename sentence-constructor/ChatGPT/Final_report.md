In the development of a learning tool aimed at assisting students with English to Swedish translation, significant progress was made through structured prompts. These prompts focus on guiding students in understanding and applying Swedish grammatical principles without direct translations.

Key developments include:

Structured Sentence Formation Guidance:

    Prompts were designed to elucidate Swedish sentence structures, emphasizing word order, verb tense, noun definiteness, and the placement of prepositions and adverbs.
    
    Special attention was given to explaining grammatical rules such as Swedish inversion in yes/no questions and the specific placement rules for prepositional phrases and adverbs.

Vocabulary and Grammar Tools:

    Comprehensive vocabulary tables covering nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs were introduced to aid in word breakdowns.
    
    Grammatical notes and optional vocabulary hints were provided to foster a deeper understanding of how Swedish differs from English, particularly in aspects like plural and definite noun forms.

Iterative Refinement:

    The prompt was continuously refined to better demonstrate sentence structure without resorting to direct translations. This included removing English auxiliary verbs that do not exist in Swedish and adjusting guidance for correct adverb placement.
    
    Feedback mechanisms were revised to ensure that the tool offers structured guidance, leveraging guided discovery methods to enhance learning effectiveness.

Overall, these efforts are directed towards creating an intuitive and student-centric learning experience, ensuring clarity and consistency in how students interact with and learn from the tool. This approach not only helps in grasping the basics but also in appreciating the nuances of Swedish grammar.
