-- Provide guidance for each sentence separately.
-- Focus on word order (SVO, etc.), question formation, and any necessary grammatical adjustments. 
-- Explicitly state the sentence type and relevant grammatical structures for each sentence. Use the following format for each sentence:
    Sentence [Sentence Number] Guidance:
        * Sentence Type:[e.g., Question, Declarative statement, Imperative]
        * Grammatical Structures:[e.g., Word order in questions, Definite plural form of nouns, Adverbial of time, Present tense verb, Prepositional phrase]
        * Guidance: [Specific hints and clues about constructing the sentence, focusing on word order, necessary grammatical adjustments, and any other relevant points. Do not provide the complete translated sentence(s).]
-- If there are multiple sentences, label the guidance (e.g., "Sentence 1 Guidance," "Sentence 2 Guidance," etc.).
- Vocabulary Hints (Optional): Include a separate section with additional vocabulary related to the sentence(s), such as singular forms of nouns, infinitives of verbs, or related words.

## Example

<example>
    <user : input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user : input>
    <Score>4</score>
    <score_reason>
    - it was good just for nouns,  adjectives and verbs 
    - it was bad for detail garmattical of definite article and prepositions so would be great to mention any grammatical or useful strcuture a Vocabulary hints or Grammar Notes.
    </reason>
    <assistant : output>

    Vocabulary Tables:

    Sentence 1 Nouns:

        | Noun in Swedish | Obestämd form (singular) | Bestämd form (singular) | Obestämd form (plural) | Bestämd form (plural) |
        |---|---|---|---|---|
        | Bear | en björn | björnen | björnar | björnarna |
        | Door | en dörr | dörren | dörrar | dörrarna |

    Sentence 2 Nouns:

        | Noun in Swedish | Obestämd form (singular) | Bestämd form (singular) | Obestämd form (plural) | Bestämd form (plural) |
        |---|---|---|---|---|
        | Garbage | sopor | soporna | sopor | |

    Sentence 1 Verbs:

        | Verb in Swedish | Present | Past | Future | Infinitive | Imperative |
        |---|---|---|---|---|---|
        | To be | är | var | ska vara | vara | var (rarely used) |

    Sentence 2 Verbs:

        | Verb in Swedish | Present | Past | Future | Infinitive | Imperative |
        |---|---|---|---|---|---|
        | To leave | lämnar | lämnade | ska lämna | lämna | lämna |

    Sentence 1 Adjectives: (No adjectives in this sentence)

    Sentence 2 Adjectives:

        | Adjective in Swedish | den form (singular) | det form (singular) | Plural |
        |---|---|---|---|
        | Out | ute | ute | ute |

    Sentence Structure Guidance:

    Sentence 1 Guidance: "Bears are at the door" translates fairly directly. Swedish word order is similar to English (Subject-Verb-Object).  
        "Björnar" (bears) is the subject   
        "är" (are) is the verb
        "vid dörren" (at the door) is the prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial

    Sentence 2 Guidance: This is a question.  In Swedish, questions often begin with the verb.
        "Did you leave..." becomes "Lämnade du..."
        "The garbage" is "soporna" (plural)
        "Out" (ute) usually comes at the end of the sentence in this type of question. Consider the placement of "ute" in relation to "soporna".

    Vocabulary Hints (Optional):  
        att vara ute (to be out/outside)

    Grammar Notes (Optional): Notice that 
        "the door" takes "den" because "dörren" is a feminine noun.  
        "Garbage" (soporna) is plural, so we use "de" before it. 
        "Lämnade" is the past tense of "lämna."
