## Example

here are example of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is.

<example>
    <user : input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user : input>
    <Score>4</score>
    <score_reason>
    - it was good just for nouns,  adjectives and verbs 
    - it was not fairly good for detail garmattical of definite article and prepositions.
    </reason>
    <assistant : output>
    Student Input: 
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

    Vocabulary Tables:

    Sentence 1 Nouns:

        | Noun in Swedish | Obestämd form (singular) | Bestämd form (singular) | Obestämd form (plural) | Bestämd form (plural) |
        |---|---|---|---|---|
        | Bear | en björn | björnen | björnar | björnarna |
        | Door | en dörr | dörren | dörrar | dörrarna |

    Sentence 2 Nouns:

        | Noun in Swedish | Obestämd form (singular) | Bestämd form (singular) | Obestämd form (plural) | Bestämd form (plural) |
        |---|---|---|---|---|
        | Garbage | sopor | soporna | sopor | |

    Sentence 1 Verbs:

        | Verb in Swedish | Present | Past | Future | Infinitive | Imperative |
        |---|---|---|---|---|---|
        | To be | är | var | ska vara | vara | var (rarely used) |

    Sentence 2 Verbs:

        | Verb in Swedish | Present | Past | Future | Infinitive | Imperative |
        |---|---|---|---|---|---|
        | To leave | lämnar | lämnade | ska lämna | lämna | lämna |

    Sentence 1 Adjectives: (No adjectives in this sentence)

    Sentence 2 Adjectives:

        | Adjective in Swedish | den form (singular) | det form (singular) | Plural |
        |---|---|---|---|
        | Out | ute | ute | ute |

    Sentence Structure Guidance:

    Sentence 1 Guidance: "Bears are at the door" translates fairly directly. Swedish word order is similar to English (Subject-Verb-Object).  "Björnar" (bears) is the subject, "är" (are) is the verb, and "vid dörren" (at the door) is the prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial.

    Sentence 2 Guidance: This is a question.  In Swedish, questions often begin with the verb.  So, "Did you leave..." becomes "Lämnade du...".  "The garbage" is "soporna" (plural). "Out" (ute) usually comes at the end of the sentence in this type of question. Consider the placement of "ute" in relation to "soporna".

    Vocabulary Hints (Optional):  att vara ute (to be out/outside)

    Grammar Notes (Optional): Notice that "the door" takes "den" because "dörren" is a feminine noun.  "Garbage" (soporna) is plural, so we use "de" before it. "Lämnade" is the past tense of "lämna."
